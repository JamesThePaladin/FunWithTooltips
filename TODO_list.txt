TODO:
Add edit job functionality

Add context menu on right click

Check for duplicate job #'s server side, and either merge both to contain the divisions or delete on if its an exact match (except for id)

TC division that is divided by other division's supers

Change pending events text to black

Assign Job popup needs functionality added to its save button to actually assign a job

Implement tooltip logic to keep them alive while hovering (lines 249-277 in Popover.html just copy paste eventMouseEnter & eventMouseLeave)
var time = 0; is declared right below the calendar declaration so it can be used globally within the calendar. place it below var calendarEl.
Then the two functions mentioned earlier can just be copy/pasted right in


things that need calendar.refetchEvents();
function:            starting line:
updateJobButton      11119
#SaveassignEvent     11073


BUGS:
Superintendent not being updated on eventDrop though it is in the code (line 10913)
This^ bug above might be a logic issue between info(info.newResource != null) on line 10917 and its closing else statement that just has ids and days (just a guess tho)


Assign Job window does not close after hitting save

Tooltips dont vanish after hovering is done

Add new does not always add the events correctly, but they do go to the database
